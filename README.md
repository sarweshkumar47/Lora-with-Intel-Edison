# LoRa-with-Intel-Edison
Interfacing Lora module with Intel Edison

##LoRa
LoRa Mote is a LoRaWAN Class A end-device based on RN2483 LoRa modem. As a standalone battery-powered node, the Mote provides a convenient platform to quickly demonstrate the long-range capabilities of the modem, as well as to verify inter-operability when connecting to LoRaWAN gateways and infrastructure.

The Mote includes light and temperature sensors, which can be transmitted either on a fixed schedule or by a button-press. An OLED display provides connection status, sensor values and acknowledgements. A standard USB interface is provided for connection to a host computer, providing a bridge to the UART interface of the RN2483 modem.
